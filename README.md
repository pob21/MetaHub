# MetaHub

MetaHub is an awesome Mac OS X tool for getting the metadata and album art for almost any song. MetaHub searches iTunes' API to find all data relevant to the song. Then with a push of a button exports the song with it's new meta data to iTunes.


MetaHub will find a songs:
- Title
- Artist
- Album Artist
- Album Name
- Genre
- Year
- Album Cover


MetaHub uses the id3v2lib (written in C) library to modify all metadata.
